1) There are a lot of variables to keep track of. Now I understand 
	that some of the variables are just grouped up in a 
	series like (x1, x2, x3) for listing and regression 
	purposes, but naming variables things like "m" in line 
	55 in MWindow.java for "number of training examples" just doesn't seem 
	like the best idea. 

2) Line 50 in MWindow.java, you create a method. This method is very long
	although it is reasonably organized, I feel like
	it can be cleaner with use of helper methods. There
	are so many for loops for different mathematical formulas, 
	it makes sense to just make a method for the formula 
	or calculation, and call a list of methods instead of
	call a ton of for loops that implement some calculation. 

3) I liked how you separated different major tasks into different classes,
	it is the correct java way to do things.
